/**
 * Tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent
 * and organize data in the form of parent child relationship.
 *
 * The topmost node of the tree is called the root.
 * the nodes below it are called the child nodes.
 * Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.
 * Parent Node: The node which is an immediate predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {B} is the parent node of {D, E}.
 * Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Examples: {D, E} are the child nodes of {B}.
 * Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node. {A} is the root node of the tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.
 * Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. {I, J, K, F, G, H} are the leaf nodes of the tree.
 * Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node. {A,B} are the ancestor nodes of the node {E}
 * Descendant: A node x is a descendant of another node y if and only if y is an ancestor of x.
 * Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {D,E} are called siblings.
 * Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.
 * Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.
 * Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.
 * Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.
